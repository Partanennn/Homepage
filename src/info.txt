Hey! I'm Aleksi and I'm 3rd year computer science student. I'm going to get my bachelor done by 2021. I'm not very design driven person but I focus trying to make beautiful and understandable code that is easy to read. Javascript, css and react(hooks) are my strongest front-end tools. From back-end the strongest is Node.js. I have done few servers for school projects so I know basics of it. You can se some of my work in github.
